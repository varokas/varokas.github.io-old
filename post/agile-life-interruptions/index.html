<h3 id="a-cost-to-stay-in:7b97ee3bb92d5d22ee5a2576b2f2586e">A cost to stay &lsquo;in&rsquo;</h3>

<p>Shig, One of my best MSE graduates pal, has this interesting idea of stop reading RSS and Facebook at all for a month. His idea is to get more time for himself to pursue what he would like to work on. Along with that idea, he also cited a few researches which point out that the younger generation brains are hard-wired to skip contents as there are too many interrupts in our life.</p>

<p>Right now I am at about 30,000 ft. in the air, deprived of my usual constant stream of contents. There is this big book in my hand that I am almost finished off. I can say that I read the whole book on the air, knowing that I won&rsquo;t be doing my usual news updating, friends connecting stuff while cruising over beautiful US west coast. In matter of fact, I couldn&rsquo;t quite remembered the last book that I was being able to complete. This is why I can&rsquo;t help but agree with Shig about the time we gave up in pursuing leads from the next coolest thing we found in RSS, just to satisfy our unending curiosity.With that said &hellip;.</p>

<h3 id="embrace-changes:7b97ee3bb92d5d22ee5a2576b2f2586e">Embrace Changes</h3>

<p>&hellip; I don&rsquo;t totally agree with cutting ourselves off the grid just to make a time for yourself. Since when that the information dictates our action but not the other way around? How do we know that what is coming is not going to be something we are going to value? And .. to sound like an Agile Evangelist: &lsquo;Changes are inevitable, instead of ignoring it, embrace it and manage it&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Instead of completely ignoring all these wonderful technologies, I&rsquo;d say SCRUM it! Make it such that our life is a little project in itself. It is okay to have change requests for yourself, as long as you consciously deal with them and did not give up your sprint goal just to tackle these changes. So here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m gonna do:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Set my personal goal for the week. My own little sprint goal.</p></li>

<li><p>See how much in a week I would like to be doing something (24x7 - work - sleep)</p></li>

<li><p>Come up with &lsquo;tasks&rsquo; for the week, which will include</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Blogging time</p></li>

<li><p>Tasks related to my weeks goal: ex. Finished chapter one of this book, learn to use python to extract stocks info, moving to Seattle etc.</p></li>

<li><p>Use my morning time to check emails, RSS feeds and Facebook news of the day.</p>

<ul>
<li>Stop push notifications for all above. I will check them myself in the morning.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>If there&rsquo;s a topic I would like to spend more time in, put it in &lsquo;reading/cool stuff&rsquo;</p></li>

<li><p>Check out cool stuff in the &lsquo;checking out cool stuff time&rsquo; or free time.</p></li>

<li><p>At the beginning of the week, see if the cool stuffs I picked up in the week earlier changes anything about what I want to do.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="re-purpose-an-old-technique:7b97ee3bb92d5d22ee5a2576b2f2586e">Re-purpose an old technique</h3>

<p>No matter how you look at it, this is the classical solution that Iterative Development tries to solve. Makes you focus only on a handful of goals while managing emerging stuff as changes that will be considered. Avoiding deciding what to do while doing. I recalled Marsha of the SEI mentioned that she used TSP to coordinate people in writing books, so why can&rsquo;t we get a little Agile into our life?</p>

<p>Will tell you more how it goes in a few weeks. Any cool thoughts? See you in the comment!</p>
